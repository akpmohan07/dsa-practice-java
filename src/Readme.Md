# 🚀 My DSA Journey in Java

**Repository:** `dsa-practice-java`  
**Namespace / GroupId:** `com.mohanverse.dev`  
**ArtifactId:** `dsa-practice-java`

This repository is my personal journey to **relearn and master Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** in Java.  
After working professionally for 4 years in Java-based applications, I wanted to **regain my DSA skills** and document my learning process for **future reference**.

## 📂 How I Organized This Repository

I organize my solutions by **topic** and **date**. Each problem solution is placed in the corresponding topic folder, and the filename starts with the date I solved it. This helps me track progress and revisit problems chronologically.

```

## 📝 How I Solve Problems

For every problem I solve, I include a **clean, readable solution** and document the following:

```java
package com.mohanverse.dev.arrays;

/**
 * Problem: Two Sum
 * Date Solved: 2025-09-24
 * Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
 * Difficulty: Easy
 * Approach: HashMap lookup
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(n)
 */
public class _2025_09_24_TwoSum {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        // Solution here
    }
}
```

This structure helps me **reflect on approaches, track patterns, and reuse templates** for similar problems in the future.

## 🎯 My Learning Goals

1. **Consistent Practice** – Solve and document problems daily.
2. **Reflect & Learn** – Track mistakes, patterns, and insights.
3. **Build a Portfolio** – Keep organized solutions for recruiters or peers.
4. **Future Reference** – Easily revisit topics or solutions months later.

---

## 🏷 Topics I’m Covering

- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stack / Queue
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming

---

## 💡 Lessons Learned

- Keep solutions **clean and readable** — avoid unnecessary boilerplate.
- Use **date-prefixed filenames** (`YYYY_MM_DD_ProblemName.java`) to track progress chronologically.
- Maintain **reusable templates** for common patterns (sliding window, DFS/BFS, binary search).
